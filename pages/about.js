                <p>
                    I'd always been interested in understanding how computers and technology worked. When I first saw code on a computer screen, I was captivated by it. It looked so cryptic, but I knew every line of code was logical and intentional. In 2019, I signed up for a beginners Python course which taught me basic programming topics. I chose Python as the use of white space made it more readable as a beginner taking their first steps into the coding universe.

                    I progressed through the course, and at a certain point, I knew enough to write a small script for a game of Hangman played at the command line. After a couple of days, I had it working. Though it was a small project consisting of a single file, I felt such satisfaction that I was able to create something on my own. I knew then that development was something I could pursue professionally one day.

                    In 2021, I decided to leave my career behind and forge a new professional life for myself, turning my interest in development into a career. For the last year+, I've been learning all about coding, how the internet works, and the ins and outs of web development.
