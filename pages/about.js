                My formal education consists of a bachelor’s degree in Finance from Florida State University, and my professional experience has primarily been in the compliance space with a focus on Anti-Money Laundering. I've worked for large, multinational firms like Citibank, N.A. in Tampa, FL and fintech "neo" banks like N26 GmbH in New York, NY.

                While I enjoyed success in my professional life, my work wasn’t fulfilling, and I knew I needed a change.

As a self-taught developer, I’ve taken numerous online courses, including:
