                <p>
                    I'd always been interested in understanding how computers and technology worked. When I first saw code on my computer screen, I was so intrigued by it. In 2019, I took a beginners Python course which taught me basic programming topics. I chose Python as the use of white space made it more readable for a newbie like me.

                    I progressed through the course, and at a certain point, I knew enough to write a small script for a game of hang man played at the command line. After a couple of days, I had it working. Though it was a small project consisting of a single script, I felt such satisfaction that I was able to create something on my own. I knew then that development was something I could pursue professionally.

                    In 2021, I decided to leave my career behind and forge a new professional life for myself, turning my interest in development into a career. For the last year+, I've been learning all about coding, how the internet works, and the ins and outs of web development.

                <p>
                    My formal education consists of a bachelor’s degree in Finance from Florida State University, and my professional experience has primarily been in the compliance space with a focus on Anti-Money Laundering. I've worked for large, multinational firms like Citibank, N.A. in Tampa, FL and fintech "neo" banks like N26 GmbH in New York, NY.
