## Description

This is my personal website. I wanted to create a website which would not only display my projects and experience, but be a project itself. I'm very excited to be able to create this and am eager to use it as a measuring stick as my development skills grow over time.

This site is built using React and Nextjs and is styled using CSS and Sass.
