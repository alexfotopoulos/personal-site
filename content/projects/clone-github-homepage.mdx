## Live link

As this project consists of a single, non-functional web page, it is not deployed. To see the page, clone/download the code from GitHub. In the terminal, navigate to the cloned/downloaded folder and run "npm install" to install the relevant packages, then run "node server.js". The result can be found at http://localhost:3000.

## Description
