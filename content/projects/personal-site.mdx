## Description

This is my personal website, the very site you're viewing now! I wanted to create a website which would not display my projects and experience, but be a project itself. I'm very excited to be able to create this and am eager to use it as a measuring stick as my development skills grow over time.

This site is built using React and Nextjs, and all of the content (project files) are stored locally as mdx files. The contact form send emails through nodemailer. The website is styled using CSS and Sass.
